Hello, I'm going to talk about technology I think is cool for this week's assignment

My shoulders have hurt for a few years now.

I went to see a doctor before but he said my spine is okay.

But I felt some shocks on my left arm and my left leg 2 months ago.

So i went to see a doctor again and found out that i have scoliosis.

He told me that My back's not gonna grow anymore. 

The most recommended treatment is to sit the right way and maintain good posture.

I bought a curble chair because it helps me maintain a good sitting position.

It helps a lot, and could help people who struggle with back problems.

you should buy this if you sit down for a long time.

thank you for watching my video
