What should you do if youâ€™re not getting along with your boyfriend/girlfriend?

If  you're not getting along with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you need to think about
the relationship again

You need to choose either fixing the problem you have with them or breaking up.

Let's say you chose fixing the problem.

There are some things you have to follow.

you need to talk about the problem with them directly.

you should schedule a time for the problems.

So they can think about the best way to communicate their feelings in a calmer and more rational way.

Also you should make requests instead of complaints.

So you and they can fix it.
