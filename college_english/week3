What should you do if youâ€™re not getting along with your boyfriend/girlfriend?





If  you're not getting along with your boyfriend or girlfriend, and are fighting often,
you need to discuss the problems calmly.

You need to choose either fixing the problems or breaking up with them.

If you choose to fix the problems, there is some steps you can follow.

You must talk about your problems directly.

Decide to schedule a time to discuss it properly.

Discussing it at a time you can both compromise on, can lead to calmer and rational thought.

The key to a good relationship is to remember why you started dating, and why it is worth it to keep going.

Also it is good to compromise and make request, rather than to complain.
