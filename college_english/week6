Tell me one good thing that you want to do, or achieve in the future.
Begin by saying "I wish I could go to..." or "I wish I had..." and then talk for a minute about it. 
("Talk about it" = specific details about what it is, when did you first want that, 
why do you want it, how are you going to make it come true, ETC!)

Hi, I'm going to talk about what i wanna achieve in the future

I wish I could make a famous application or a game that everyone knows.

I like to play games and seeing how a program works is interesting, so I wanted to do one of my own.

My interest in software made me want to study how to code.

Since then, I applied to the university for software engineering. 

I plan to put a lot of effort into studying my major, doing projects with my friends with Android Studio which I learned by myself.

After I graduate, I wish to work for a company that deals with software development and see it firsthand.

Maybe one day I can make a game or application by myself or with my friends.

Thank you for watching my video
