Tell me one good thing that you want to do, or achieve in the future.
Begin by saying "I wish I could go to..." or "I wish I had..." and then talk for a minute about it. 
("Talk about it" = specific details about what it is, when did you first want that, 
why do you want it, how are you going to make it come true, ETC!)


I wish I could make a famous application or a game that everyone knows.

I like to play games and seeing how a program works is interesting, so I wanted to do one of my own.

My interest in software made me want to study how to code.

Since then, I applied to the university for software engineering. 


I plan to put a lot of effort into studying my major, doing projects with my friends with Android Studio which I learned by myself.

After I graduate, I wish to work for a company that deals with software development and see it firsthand.

Maybe one day I can make a game or application by myself or with my friends.
