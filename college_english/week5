Today, i'm going to talk about my funny story that happened to me on chuseok

I visited my grandma when i was 9 with my family on chuseok

It was my sister and I's first time visiting the church so we were somewhat nervous. 

The pastor brought us to a big room along with other children for sports day. 

We made some friends throughout the day and had fun that day.

Afterwards, we went back to my grandma's house.

There was a playground in front of her house, so my sister and I went to play there.

We made some more friends at the playground, and an older man with some toys in his hands

 walked up to us and asked if we needed toys. 

So my sister and I took the dominos and the toy car.

thank you for watching my video
