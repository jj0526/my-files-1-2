I visited my grandma when i was 9 with my family on chuseok

My sister, grandma, and I went to the church in the weekend

It was first time for my sister and me to visit there

so we were kinda nervous. The teacher???? brought us to a big room for sports day

The teacher gave us a pencil with crab(????) on it

We made some friends and had fun there.

We went back to my grandma's house

There is a playground in front of her house, so I and my sister went there  

We made more friends from there and an old guy went to us and asked us if anyone need the toys

So i and my sister took them. They are dominos and a big car.
